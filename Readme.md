# What's Bat files?
Bat files is a repo I'm going to be passively making as I make batch files that I might re-use in the future. Below is a list of each bat file and what it does.

## Bat files
- lines.bat
	- Usage: lines -n
	- Creates a text file, test.txt, with lines *n*, with each line being "This is a test *x*" where *x* is an incrementing varable that stops at *n*.
	- The first line of the txt file is just "This is a test"
